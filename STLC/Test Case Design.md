To create test cases for the features of the GroceryMate Webshop, 
I will break down the key functionalities of the webshop based on its primary 
features. Since I don't have access to the site directly, I'll focus on 
common web features for e-commerce sites like product search, cart 
functionality, payment gateway, order management, and user accounts.

## **Key Features to Test:**

1. User Registration & Login
2. Product Search & Filter
3. Product Details Page
4. Shopping Cart
5. Checkout Process
6. Payment Gateway Integration
7. Order Confirmation and Tracking
8. User Profile Management
9. Product Reviews and Ratings
10. Admin Panel (for backend management)


### **1. User Registration & Login**

**Test Design Techniques**: Boundary Value Analysis (BVA), Equivalence Partitioning (EP), Error Guessing

### Test Cases:

**Boundary Value Analysis**:
- **Test Case**: Verify successful registration with valid email.
  - **Input**: Email: valid@example.com, Password: "ValidPassword123"
  - **Expected Outcome**: Registration successful, and the user is redirected to the homepage.
- **Test Case**: Verify unsuccessful registration with invalid email.
  - **Input**: Email: "invalidemail.com", Password: "ValidPassword123"
  - **Expected Outcome**: Error message "Invalid email format."

**Equivalence Partitioning**:
- **Test Case**: Verify login for registered user.
  - **Input**: Email: valid@example.com, Password: "ValidPassword123"
  - **Expected Outcome**: User is logged in successfully and redirected to the dashboard.
- **Test Case**: Verify login for unregistered user.
  - **Input**: Email: "notregistered@example.com", Password: "WrongPassword123"
  - **Expected Outcome**: Error message "Invalid email or password."

**Error Guessing**:
- **Test Case**: Verify system behavior when password field is left empty.
  - **Input**: Email: valid@example.com, Password: ""
  - **Expected Outcome**: Error message "Password is required."


### **2. Product Search & Filter**

**Test Design Techniques**: Boundary Value Analysis (BVA), Equivalence Partitioning (EP), Exploratory Testing

### Test Cases:

**Boundary Value Analysis:**:
- **Test Case**: Verify product search with valid keyword.
  - **Input**: Search term: "Apples"
  - **Expected Outcome**: Search results show products related to "Apples."

- **Test Case**: Verify product search with empty keyword.
  - **Input**: Search term: ""
  - **Expected Outcome**: Error message "Please enter a search term."

**Equivalence Partitioning:**:
- **Test Case**: Verify product search with valid product name
  - **Input**: "Apples"
  - **Expected Outcome**: Matching products are displayed.
  
- **Test Case**: Verify filtering by category.
  - **Input**: Category filter: "Fruits"
  - **Expected Outcome**: Only fruits items are listed.

- **Test Case**: Verify price range filter
  - **Input**: Price range: $10 - $20
  - **Expected Outcome**: Products within the specified price range are displayed.

**Error Guessing**:

- **Test Case**: Verify system behavior with only special characters
  - **Input**: "@#$%^&*()"
  - **Expected Outcome**: Error or message: "No results found."

- **Test Case**: Verify system behavior with excessively long input
  - **Input**: 1000-character string (e.g., "a"*1000)
  - **Expected Outcome:** System handles gracefully (e.g., truncates or shows "No results found").

- **Test Case**: Search using emojis or unsupported Unicode
  - **Input**: "ü•¶üçéüõí"
  - **Expected Outcome**: Error or message: "No results found."

- **Test Case**: Search with leading/trailing spaces
  - **Input**: " Milk "
  - **Expected Outcome**: Input is trimmed; results for "Milk" shown.
  
### **3. Profile Story**

**Test Design Techniques**: Boundary Value Analysis (BVA), Equivalence Partitioning (EP), Error Guessing

### Test Cases:

1. **Boundary Value Analysis**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify the profile story with exactly 100 characters.
        - **Input**: Enter a story with 100 characters.
        - **Expected Outcome**: Story saved successfully and displayed under the account name.
2. **Boundary Value Analysis**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify the profile story with more than 100 characters.
        - **Input**: Enter a story with 101 characters.
        - **Expected Outcome**: Error message "Profile story cannot exceed 100 characters."
3. **Equivalence Partitioning**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify the profile story with less than 100 characters.
        - **Input**: Enter a story with 50 characters.
        - **Expected Outcome**: Story saved successfully and displayed under the account name.
4. **Error Guessing**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify the profile story with no input.
        - **Input**: Leave the story field empty.
        - **Expected Outcome**: Story saved successfully (if empty story is allowed).
5. **Error Guessing**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify the profile story with invalid characters or profanity.
        - **Input**: Enter a story with prohibited words.
        - **Expected Outcome**: Error message "Profile story contains prohibited content."
6. **Use Case Testing**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify that the profile story is aligned and visible below the account name on the profile page.
        - **Input**: Navigate to the user's profile page.
        - **Expected Outcome**: The profile story should be displayed directly below the account name, properly aligned and fully visible.
7. **Use Case Testing**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify that the profile story is visible to registered users.
        - **Input**: A registered user navigates to the profile page of the user with the story.
        - **Expected Outcome**: The registered user should be able to see the profile story below the account name on the profile page.
8. **Use Case Testing**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify that the profile story is not visible to unregistered users.
        - **Input**: An unregistered user navigates to the profile page of the user with the story.
        - **Expected Outcome**: The profile story should not be visible to the unregistered user; it may be hidden or replaced with a message prompting the user to log in to view the content.
9. **Boundary Value Analysis (Input Validation)**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify the system's behavior when the profile story field is left empty.
        - **Input**: Leave the profile story input field empty and attempt to save.
        - **Expected Outcome**: The system should either allow saving an empty story (if allowed) or display an error message indicating that the profile story cannot be empty.
10. **Use Case Testing (Session Expiry)**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify the system's behavior when the user is editing their bio and the session expires.
        - **Input**: Let the session expire while editing the profile story, then log back in.
        - **Expected Outcome**: The system should not save the changes made during the expired session. Upon logging back in, the user should see the profile story in its state before the session expired, and any unsaved changes should be lost.
