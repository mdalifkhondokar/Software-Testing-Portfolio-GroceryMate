      - Safari (for iOS and macOS)
      - Microsoft Edge
    - Dependencies: 
      - May rely on local storage or a lightweight backend (to be confirmed)
      - No third-party login or payment integration identified
      - JavaScript and modern front-end frameworks likely used

### **Product Functionality**

The product allows users to:

- Register and log in
- Add grocery items manually
- Organize and categorize items (e.g. produce, dairy, pantry)
- Edit or delete items from the list
- View and manage a shopping list from any device with a browser
- Mark items as completed or purchased (presumed functionality)
- Interact with a responsive and minimalistic UI
- Possibly save data locally (e.g. via localStorage)

## **2. Design the Test Strategy – GroceryMate**

### **Scope of Testing**

- **In Scope:**
    - Adding grocery items to a list
    - Editing and deleting items from the list
    - Marking items as completed/purchased (if available)
    - Categorizing grocery items (if implemented)
    - User interaction via mobile and desktop browsers
    - Responsiveness across devices
    - Data persistence in local storage
    - Validation of input fields (e.g. empty fields, duplicates)
    - UI/UX behavior (transitions, button clicks, accessibility basics)
  
- **Out of Scope:**
    - Backend database/API functionality (if not exposed to frontend)
    - Multi-user features (since no login or authentication is present)
    - Payment systems or third-party service integrations
    - Cloud synchronization across devices

### **Type of Testing**

- Functional Testing – Verifying core features: add, edit, delete items, and UI functionality.
- Regression Testing – Ensuring newly added changes don’t break existing features.
- Performance Testing – Checking for performance degradation with a large number of list items.
- Usability Testing – Validating that the interface is intuitive, simple, and user-friendly.
- Security Testing – Verifying that data is protected (e.g., input validation to prevent XSS/SQL injection, secure storage, and access control for sensitive actions). 
- Compatibility Testing – Ensuring proper function on different devices, screen sizes, and browsers.
- Accessibility Testing – Basic checks (e.g., keyboard navigation, contrast, labels for screen readers).

### **Risks and Issues**

- **No backend or cloud support:**
    - Mitigation: Communicate data persistence limitations; implement alerts/warnings for data loss.
- **Browser-dependent storage (e.g., localStorage):**
    - Mitigation: Test in incognito/private mode; simulate cleared cache scenarios.
- **Incomplete feature set or evolving prototype:**
    - Mitigation: Prioritize testing stable features; perform ongoing testing in agile cycles.
- **UI responsiveness issues across devices:**
    - Mitigation: Use device emulators and real devices in QA testing process.

### **Test Logistics**

- **Patrick Bauer** - Test Manager
- **Md Alif Khondokar** - QA Engineer (Functional and Regression Testing)
- **Maria L** - QA Engineer (Performance and Security Testing)
- **Ronny** - QA Engineer (Usability Testing)
- **Maria Garcia** - End User for UAT

## **3. Define Test Objectives – GroceryMate**

### **Objectives**

- **Functionality:** Ensure that users can add, edit, delete, and manage grocery items as intended.
- **GUI:** Verify that the user interface is clean, responsive, and behaves consistently across devices.
- **Performance:** Confirm that the application handles a large number of items without lag or errors.
- **Security:** Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Usability:** Assess whether users can intuitively interact with the platform without guidance.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure the application works smoothly across major browsers and screen sizes.
- **Data Persistence:** Validate that grocery lists remain intact after refreshing or navigating away (if applicable).

### **Expected Outcomes**

- **Functionality:** All core list management features operate reliably and without bugs.
- **GUI:** The interface is visually consistent, responsive, and free of layout or design issues.
- **Performance:** The app remains fast and responsive even with large item lists.
- **Security:** No significant vulnerabilities are detected.
- **Usability:** Users can perform tasks easily without confusion or error
- **Compatibility:** The app functions correctly on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge across mobile and desktop.
- **Data Persistence:** Grocery lists persist between sessions (if intended), or provide clear guidance if not.

## **4. Define Test Criteria – GroceryMate**

### **Suspension Criteria**

- Testing will be suspended if critical defects are discovered that prevent further testing of core features (e.g., adding or managing grocery items).
- Testing will also be suspended in the event of:
    - Major application crashes or data loss
    - Inaccessibility of the test environment
    - Lack of required resources (testers, tools, devices)

### **Exit Criteria**

- All planned test cases have been created, reviewed, and executed.
- Run Rate: At least 95% of all test cases have been executed.
- Pass Rate: At least 90% of executed test cases have passed.
- All **critical** and **high-priority** defects have been resolved and verified.
- No open **Severity 1 (Blocker)** or **Severity 2 (Major)** defects remain.
- Application meets performance benchmarks with acceptable load time and responsiveness.
- Any identified security or data persistence issues have been addressed.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** is completed, and formal approval is received from stakeholders.
